It is important to identify the variables that influence and predict the life expectancy of a country's population in order to develop appropriate strategies to improve the quality and performance of the healthcare system and thereby increase life expectancy. Research conducted to estimate life expectancy focuses on modeling life expectancy using multivariate linear regression or multiple linear regression based on observed health and mortality trends in the population, as well as social, economic, and environmental factors in a country.

Using multiple regression analysis I find the estimated value of the regression coefficient for each unit of the independent variable, assuming the other variables remain constant. In addition, I also test the statistical significance of the regression coefficients, which indicates whether or not there is a significant relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable. Multiple regression analysis can also be used to predict the value of the life expectancy variable based on known values of the independent variables, using the regression equation that has been formed."
